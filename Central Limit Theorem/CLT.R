
# Central limit theorem statement - If X_hat is the mean of a random sample of size N taken
# from a population with mean mu and finite standard deviation sigma, then the limiting form of
# the distribution of Z = (X_hat - mu)/(singma/sqrt(N)) as N approaches infinity,
# is the standard normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

# Since distribution doesn't matter for central limit theorem we will demonstrate central limit 
# theorem using uniform distribution with values ranging from -10 to 10.

mean(d)
# so the plot will resemble uniform distribution and the black line in the plot shows the mean
# which is close to 0. This is the true mean of the population. 

# Assumptions - 
# 1. Our data consists of 10,000 values randomly sampled from uniform distribution. a = -10, b = 10.
# 2. We will make 5000 samples, each with sample size 5, 10, 15, 30, 50, 100.
# 3. We are sampling with replacement.

# Note - If we dont take 10,000 samples and just randomly sample N elements from it, then also it works
# I just took 10,000 for the sake of demonstration. You can prove this with any data, take any 
# online data, take any one column with real values and you can prove Central limit theorem.

# 1. All the plots are normal distributions. 
# 2. looking at the 6 plots we see that as we increase the sample size, the standard deviation decreases,
# as our plot shrinks. 
# 3. The shrinking of the plot, justifies the sigma/sqrt(N) standard deviation as mentioned in Central
# limit theorem, as N increases standard deviation decreases. 
# 4. All the plots have mean which is close to the true mean of the 10,000 samples.
