# Central Limit Theorem

1. Image folder contains the plot of data distribution drawn from uniform distribution, the plots of sample size 5, 15, 30, 50, 100, 500
2. Image folder real world data contains the plots of real world data and proving central limit theorem using it.
3. Famous Iris data set is used for proving, Iris is built in R data set, so no need to import it
4. Assumptions and Conclusion are written in CLT.R
