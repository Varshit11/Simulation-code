# Simulation-code

This is the code for computing the value of pi.

I have tried various values of radius in the increasing order and we can infer that as we increase the value of radius and keep the value of number of iterations same, the value of pi gets close to its true value. 

This is the screenshot of the output of the code. I have used value of radius to be 5, 10, 15, 25, 50, 100, 200 and we can see it converges to the true value of pi.
